# Impact-of-agriculture-types-on-world-population
Every major advance in agriculture has allowed global population to increase. Early farmers could settle down to a steady food supply. Irrigation, the ability to clear large swaths of land for farming efficiently, and the development of farm machines powered by fossil fuels allowed people to grow more food and transport it to where it was needed.

The flip side to this is that for the population to continue to grow, more advances in agriculture and an ever increasing supply of water will be needed. Weâ€™ve increased the carrying capacity for humans by our genius: growing crops, trading for needed materials, and designing ways to exploit resources that are difficult to get at, such as groundwater. And most of these resources are limited.

I want to research influence of agriculture on population growth .
